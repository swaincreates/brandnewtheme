# brandnewtheme

Hi. I'm a copy of the '_s' theme with a gulpfile, bootstrap 3.3.5, and a slightly different arrangement of assets. Navigation has been replaced with bootstrap's navbar and a custom navwalker found [here](https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navwalker). I'm still pretty fresh, so leave a note if you have any issue.

## Getting Started

* search and replace 'brandnewtheme' with your special theme name. 
* Run `npm install`.
* `gulp watch` and you're good to go

## Notes

* There is a random number assigned to css and js versions so that cache will bust in staging sites, remove in production
* The .bowerrc file makes `assets/vendor` the root folder for bower installs.

## To Do

* Maybe bootstrapify more of the templates
* Maybe switch to bootstrap-sass
